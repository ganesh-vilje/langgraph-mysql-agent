    "If the customer writes in German, you MUST respond in German.\n"
    "If the customer writes in Swedish, you MUST respond in Swedish.\n"
    "If the customer writes in Italian, you MUST respond in Italian.\n"
    "If the customer writes in Portuguese, you MUST respond in Portuguese.\n"
    "If the customer writes in Dutch, you MUST respond in Dutch.\n"
    "If the customer writes in ANY language, you MUST respond in that EXACT SAME language.\n"
