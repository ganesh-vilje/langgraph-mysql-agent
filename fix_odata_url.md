# Fix OData URL Issue

## Problem
The base URL in your `.env` file includes `/SalesOrder` at the end, which causes the URL to become:
```
https://arcecommerce.orangocloud.com:8348/ArcEcommerce_test/ODataV4/Company('Arc%20E-Commerce')/SalesOrder/SalesList
```

This is invalid because `SalesOrder` is a collection and cannot be followed by another segment.

## Solution
Update your `.env` file to remove `/SalesOrder` from the base URL.

### Current (Wrong):
```env
DYNAMICS_NAV_BASE_URL=https://arcecommerce.orangocloud.com:8348/ArcEcommerce_test/ODataV4/Company('Arc%20E-Commerce')/SalesOrder
```

### Correct:
```env
DYNAMICS_NAV_BASE_URL=https://arcecommerce.orangocloud.com:8348/ArcEcommerce_test/ODataV4/Company('Arc%20E-Commerce')
```

## What This Will Do
After the fix, the URL will be:
```
https://arcecommerce.orangocloud.com:8348/ArcEcommerce_test/ODataV4/Company('Arc%20E-Commerce')/SalesList
```

This is the correct OData URL structure.

## Steps to Fix
1. Open your `.env` file
2. Find the line with `DYNAMICS_NAV_BASE_URL`
3. Remove `/SalesOrder` from the end
4. Save the file
5. Restart your API server

## Test the Fix
After making the change, test with:
```bash
python test_odata_url.py
```

You should see the correct URL structure without the duplicate `/SalesOrder/SalesList`.
