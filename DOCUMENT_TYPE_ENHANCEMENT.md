# Document Type Handling Enhancement

## Problem Identified

The original LangGraph MySQL Agent was missing **document type handling** in its intent recognition system. When users asked questions like:
- "What type of document is this?"
- "Show me all invoices"
- "Is this a quote or an order?"
- "List all quotes"

The system would not understand these queries and wouldn't provide the requested document type information.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts

**Added Document Type Intent Recognition Section:**
```
ðŸ“„ DOCUMENT TYPE QUERIES:
- 'what type of document', 'document type', 'is this an invoice', 'is this a quote' â†’ Use query_odata with Document_Type field
- 'invoice', 'quote', 'order', 'credit memo', 'return order' â†’ Use query_by_document_type tool
- 'show me all invoices', 'list all quotes', 'find orders' â†’ Use query_by_document_type tool
- 'document type is', 'type of document' â†’ Use query_odata to get and explain Document_Type value
- 'all quotes for customer X' â†’ Use query_by_document_type with additional filters
```

**Added Document Type Values Mapping:**
```
DOCUMENT TYPE VALUES (common in Dynamics NAV):
- 'Quote' = Sales Quote
- 'Order' = Sales Order
- 'Invoice' = Sales Invoice
- 'Credit Memo' = Sales Credit Memo
- 'Return Order' = Sales Return Order
- 'Blanket Order' = Sales Blanket Order
```

**Updated Technical Field Mapping:**
```
- Document_Type: Document Type (Quote, Order, Invoice, Credit Memo, etc.)
```

### 2. New Tool: `query_by_document_type`

Created a specialized tool for document type queries with:
- **Smart document type mapping** (handles variations like "invoice" â†’ "Invoice")
- **Automatic field selection** (always includes Document_Type field)
- **Combined filtering** (can add additional filters like customer, date, etc.)
- **User-friendly responses** (explains document types in plain language)

### 3. Enhanced Search Functionality

Updated `search_odata_data` to recognize document type keywords:
- Detects queries containing "invoice", "quote", "order", etc.
- Automatically filters by Document_Type when appropriate
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing search functionality

### 4. Updated Agent Configuration

- Added the new `query_by_document_type` tool to the agent
- Updated system prompts in both `main.py` and `api.py`
- Enhanced instructions for document type handling

## Files Modified

1. **`main.py`** - Added document type intent recognition to console interface
2. **`api.py`** - Added document type intent recognition to API interface  
3. **`agent/agent.py`** - Added new tool to agent configuration
4. **`tools/odata_tool.py`** - Added `query_by_document_type` tool and enhanced search
5. **`test_document_type.py`** - Created test script to demonstrate functionality

## How It Works Now

### Before (Missing Document Type Handling):
```
User: "What type of document is order OF0000001?"
Agent: [Generic response, doesn't understand document type intent]
```

### After (Enhanced Document Type Handling):
```
User: "What type of document is order OF0000001?"
Agent: 
1. Recognizes this as a document type query
2. Uses query_odata with Document_Type field
3. Returns: "Order OF0000001 is a Sales Quote (Document Type: Quote)"
```

### Example Queries Now Supported:

1. **Direct Document Type Questions:**
   - "What type of document is this?"
   - "Is this an invoice or a quote?"

2. **Document Type Filtering:**
   - "Show me all invoices"
   - "List all quotes"
   - "Find all orders"

3. **Combined Queries:**
   - "Show me all quotes for customer CUST001"
   - "List invoices from last month"

4. **Document Type Explanations:**
   - "What does 'Quote' mean?"
   - "Explain the difference between Order and Invoice"

## Benefits

1. **Complete Intent Recognition** - System now understands all major query types
2. **User-Friendly Responses** - Explains document types in plain language
3. **Flexible Querying** - Supports both specific and general document type queries
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Extensible Design** - Easy to add new document types or query patterns

## Testing

Run the test script to see the enhanced functionality:
```bash
python test_document_type.py
```

This will demonstrate various document type queries and show how the system now properly handles them.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Document Types** - Can easily add more document types as needed
2. **Advanced Filtering** - Could add date ranges, amount ranges, etc.
3. **Document Type Statistics** - Could add queries like "How many quotes do we have?"
4. **Document Workflow** - Could add queries about document status and workflow

The system is now fully equipped to handle document type queries and provide users with the information they need!
